Conclusion:
The proposed model is doing good at predicting the letters. But still, we can see a lot of fluctuation in the real-time predictions. 
Even a slight hand movement is making the neural network to change its predictions. This is also called as â€˜flickering'.

Future work: 
- Creating full sentences  instead of just alphabets
- Customise model for all sign languages
- Creating automatic editors
